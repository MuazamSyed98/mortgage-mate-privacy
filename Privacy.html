        <h1>Privacy Policy for Mortgage Mate</h1>
        <div class="updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 7, 2025</div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how Mortgage Mate handles your information. 
            We are committed to protecting your privacy. Mortgage Mate is designed to operate locally on your device, 
            and the App does not collect, store, or share any personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Mortgage Mate functions completely offline. This means:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect, transmit, or store personal information such as names, email addresses, income details, or financial information.</li>
            <li>No data is sent to any external servers.</li>
            <li>We do not use analytics tools, advertising trackers, or third-party data services.</li>
            <li>Your usage of the app is not monitored or tracked.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Local Data Processing</h2>
        <p>
            Any information you enter—such as loan amounts, interest rates, or calculation settings—is processed instantly 
            on your device. None of this information leaves your device.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you delete the App, all information you entered will be permanently removed unless it is part of an iCloud device backup.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Mortgage Mate does not integrate with external services, SDKs, or APIs that collect or track data. 
            The App relies entirely on Apple’s secure iOS environment.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Because the App does not collect or store any data, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children 
            under the age of 13.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected on this page and become effective 
            immediately once posted. You are encouraged to review this page periodically.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
