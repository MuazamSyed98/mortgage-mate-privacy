Privacy Policy for Mortgage Mate

Last Updated: December 7, 2025

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Mortgage Mate ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Mortgage Mate does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All calculations and inputs remain on your device.

2. No Data Collection

Mortgage Mate is designed to operate fully offline and locally.

We do not collect, transmit, or store personal information such as names, email addresses, income details, or financial information.

No data is sent to external servers, and we do not use analytics, tracking technologies, or advertising tools.

Your usage of the app is not monitored.

3. Local Data Storage

Any information you enter into Mortgage Mate—such as loan amounts, interest rates, or calculation preferences—is processed only on your device in real time.

No information is backed up to developer servers.

If you delete the App, all data you entered will be permanently removed unless your device backup (e.g., iCloud) contains it.

4. Third-Party Services

Mortgage Mate does not integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs that collect or track user data. The App relies solely on Apple’s secure iOS environment.

5. Children’s Privacy

Because the App does not collect any data, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. You are encouraged to review this page from time to time for changes. Any updates will be posted here and take effect immediately upon posting.
